LookingForSteamPlayers.com was developed during the Insight Data Science program, http://www.insightdatascience.com/. 

The goal of this project was to create a website where PC gamers could quickly and easily find people to play with based on their gaming tastes. When this project was developed the only way in which to find other gamers was to happen upon them in game, or to post and search on forums such as http://www.reddit.com/r/steamship.  But in the digital age with numerous websites matching people for marriage, there had to be a better way!  

LookingForSteamPlayers.com uses a database of Steam users, their games, and their respective playtimes on those games in order to then rate similarity with other uses based on cosine similarity. The database of Steam users is currently 50,000 and growing. Additionally, when a user makes a request to the site, they are permanently added to the database.
